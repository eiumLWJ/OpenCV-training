# Smooth or bluring to reduce noise (caused by sensor, lightening)

# GAUSSIAN METHOD
# We need to define a window (kernel), the pixels of the window (ksize, window size) are changed. 
# The center pixel intensity is the average of the surrounding ones

#Averaging
ksize = (3,3)
average = cv.blur(img,ksize)
cv.imshow('Average Blur', average)

# The highter is the ksize, more blured will be the image
# ksize = (7,7)
average = cv.blur(img,ksize)
cv.imshow('Average Blur', average)

# Gaussian blur, more natural, using the same ksize, we will see it less blured
gauss = cv.GaussianBlur(img,ksize,0)
cv.imshow('Gaussian Blur',gauss)

# Median blur, instead finding the average, uses the median
# More effective, mostly used in 'Salt&Pepper' noise images
# ksize at this time will be just an int and not meant for ksizes as 5 or 7, is more for 3
median = cv.medianBlur(img,3,0)
cv.imshow('Median Blur',median)

# Bilateral 
# Most effective because it retains the edges in image
# sigmaColour, when larger it is, more colours will be considered
# sigmaSpace, when larger it is, more pixels from center will be considered
bilateral = cv.bilateralFilter(img, 5, 15, 15)
